Preparing for your first mountain bike event
#####################

Your first mountain bike event is a big deal and it's an entirely new world of fun and fitness.  But what do you need to get ready for it so that you can have a safe, fun time?

Equipment
=============================
1.  A bike.  It doesn't need to be new, but you want one that has a decent suspension on it to make the ride go a bit smoother.
2.  A biking helmet.  Safety first, protect your head!
3.  Bike gloves
4.  Good set of shoes. You want your feet to stay on the pedals fairly easily.
5.  Water bottles.  Stay hydrated!
6.  A first-aid kit.
7.  A repair kit with a bike flat repair patch in it.  Bike flats happen all the time.
8.  Bike shorts.  These go on as a base layer and they are padded which REALLY helps with walking normal later.

Where can I read more?
========================

You should read a lot so that you are prepared for your first ride and it goes off without a hitch.  Afterall, this is the start of your new great hobby.

Forums
--------
Forums are a great place to read up a bit.  I personally like https://forums.mtbr.com as they are one of the biggest mountain biking forums out there and there are always so many discussions going on that you can pick up so much information so fast it’s unbelievable. Sometimes just jumping it is the best way to get immersed in a topic

MTB Blogs
----------
 Blogs are another great place to get information. Frequently they have beginner sections as well as list of recommended equipment to help you get going. I like the one over at  https://MountainBikeExperience.com because it even has posts like how to size your bike the right way so that it’s comfortable and effective for riding. 
 
 There are many out there to read up on topics and you really should read on quite a few blogs so that you get a wide range of information so that you can keep asking questions and finding the info and learning so that on your first ride you're not totally lost.
 
Your Local Bike Shop
---------------------
 Remember that you always have a local bike shop and this is one of the really great place to socially hang out with people knowledgeable to work on the bikes as well as other riders. It’s a great place to make friends and it’s a good way to step into things. I do recommend reading a little bit first so that you can cross is somebody new but not clueless.
